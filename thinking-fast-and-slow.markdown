## Thinking Fast and Slow

by Daniel Kahneman

### Introduction

* We use resemblance as a simplifying heuristic to make difficult judgment, causing predictable biases in predictions.
* Social scientists in the 1970s broadly accepted that people are generally rational, and emotions such as fear, affection, and hatred explain departures from rationality.
* People tend to assess the relative importance of issues by the ease with which they are retrieved from memory, which is largely determined by the media.
* Accurate intuitions of experts are better explained by the effects of prolonged practice than by heuristics.
* Valid intuitions develop when experts have learned to recognize familiar elements in a new situation and to act in a manner that is appropriate to it.
* When faced with a difficult question, we often answer an easier one instead, usually without noticing the substitution.
* When intuition fails, because neither an expert solution nor a heuristic answer comes to mind, we resort to slower, deliberate, and effortful thinking.

### Part I: Two Systems

#### Ch 1: The Characters of the Story

* System 1 operates automatically and quickly, with no effort and no voluntary control.
* System 2 allocates attention to effortful mental activities. It's associated with the subjective experience of agency, choice, and concentration.
* All operations of System 2 require attention and are disrupted when attention is drawn away.
* System 2 has some ability to change the way System 1 works, by programming the normally automatic functions of attention and memory.
* System 1 generates impressions, intuitions, intentions, and feelings. Those endorsed by System 2 turn into beliefs and voluntary actions.
* Most of what System 2 thinks and does originates in your System 1, but System 2 takes over when things get difficult, and it normally has the last word.
* One of the tasks of System 2 is to overcome the impulses of System 1. System 2 is in charge of self-control.
* System 2 is too slow and inefficient to substitute for System 1. The best we can do is to recognize when mistakes are likely, and to try harder to avoid significant mistakes when the stakes are high.
